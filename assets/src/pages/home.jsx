                                                    <strong>Linguistics:</strong> Linguistics forms the foundation of TESOL. 
                                                    It helps teachers understand the structure, grammar, syntax, phonetics, and phonology of the English language,

                                                    Educators adapt and apply theories of learning, instructional design, assessment, and classroom management to the 
                                                    specific context of teaching English as a second or foreign language.

                                                    of cultural awareness and sensitivity. Incorporating elements of cultural studies helps teachers promote intercultural

                                                    and learner psychology is crucial for effective TESOL instruction. Applied linguistics research, which combines elements of linguistics, 
                                                    psychology, and education, explores language-related phenomena in real-world contexts and informs TESOL practices.
